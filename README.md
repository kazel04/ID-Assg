# Interactive Demo Website for a Mental Health Chatbot Assistant

This website was developed to gain the attention of youths who are looking to try out the mental health chatbot assistant through the usage of animations, demo images and interactive chatbots. 

The key goal of the website is to encourage youths as well as organisations to try out the chatbot themselves by signing up for a free trial account.
A secondary purpose is to inform users about the purpose of the new social project, Psyche, as well as provide the means for users to send enquiries about the social project.
 
## Design Process
 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
  
2. Signup form:
    1. Go to Signup form
    2. Try to Submit form without a Name (Cannot Submit)
    3. Try to Submit form without a Surname (Cannot Submit)
    4. Try to Submit form without a Valid email address (Cannot submit)
    5. Try to Submit form without a Valid Password (Cannot Submit)
    6. From the above testing the Signup Form is working as unless the users fills up all the required pats, they cannot submit it.
   
3. Clicking on the Different Sections
    1. Go to the Index Page
    2. Try to Click on different Sections (Was able to)
    3. From the above testing, the links are working
  
4. Animations 
    1. Go to the Main Page and ensure the animation is working
    2. Go to the Subpages and ensure that the Text animation and the background animation is working
    3. Click on the Main Page and ensure the following pages animation are working

5. Chatbot
    1. Click on the Chatbots
    2. When prompted by the Chatbot to type 'Yes, i agree', ensure that sentence must be typed (Working)
    3. Ensure the chatbot is able to have a conversation with the user and is working (Working)

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
