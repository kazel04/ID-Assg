# Psyche Info Website
Interactive Demo Website for a Mental Health Chatbot Assistant

This website was developed to gain the attention of youths who are looking to try out the mental health chatbot assistant through the usage of animations, demo images and interactive chatbots. The key goal of the website is to encourage youths as well as organisations to try out the chatbot themselves by signing up for a free trial account.

A secondary purpose is to inform users about the purpose of the new social project, Psyche, as well as provide the means for users to send enquiries about the social project.


The website uses Google Firebase APIs to sign up users and to store any assets used. 

A Kommunicate(chatbot provider) API was also used tom provide a live demo of the chatbot, and the Kommunicate chatbot itself is connected to Google's Dialogflow API.

Lottie animations are used to enhance the design of the website while a lucky box game which provides free perks to individual users allows for the gamification of the website for the enhancement of the user experience.
